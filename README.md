###About

This is a simple open-source script that monitors observable private activity on the KMD blockchain.

Using this script can help you recognize when other users on the system are executing privacy actions. If you perform privacy actions during this time yourself, the odds that you will be able to effectively break your cryptocurrency trail are much higher than when activity is low.

The script is built to run on Ubuntu (GNU/Linux OS).

###Installation
  - Install [Node.js](www.nodejs.org)
  - In the terminal execute: `git clone https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/resources.git`
  - Execute `npm install`
  - Execute `npm start`
